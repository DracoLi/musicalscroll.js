musicalscroll.js
-----------

Make scrolling on your site much more musical.

### Setup:

1. Include "musical.js" in your page.
2. Initialize the musicalscroll once DOM has loaded:

```javascript
// Play a musical note every 800 pixels scrolled
// By default we use 400px
fartscroll(800); 
```

Inspired by [fartscroll.js](http://theonion.github.io/fartscroll.js/), but now much more elegant.
